# memory-dump
 A random warehousing of various scripts and tools.

**DISCLAIMER**: Some of these functions (ok, most of them) aren't 100% bulletproof; they may not completely work your situation. Please feel free to send PRs to improve them! I'm always happy to learn, receive feedback and generally hear how others use this junk :)
